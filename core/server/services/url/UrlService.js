     * Happens as soon as the routes are registered in express.
     * Or, you can add routes during the runtime.
     *
     * e.g. imagine we have an interface later. You can add/modify/delete routes.
     * We can add a `updateRoute` fn, it will search for it's url generator and update all the urls.
     * We also need to ensure that e.g. if a filter changes during the runtime, we need to re-ask if the
     * filter matches a resource.
     *
     * We could also order the routes with e.g. `reorderRoutes`, which will change the order of the
     * url generator array and the queue order - need to figure out how to easily change this.
     *
     * There are two types of routes:
     *  - 1. collections (permalink based, need to be generated)
     *  - 2. static routes (e.g. for apps, static home page)
     *
     *  Still, every route is unique.
     *
     *  e.g. you add /subscribe/ and there is a slug subscribe and a permlink /:slug/ which would own the post.
     *  It depends on the order of route registration who owns the URL first.
